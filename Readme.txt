This folder contains practice files.  These files were created to develop and learn HyperText Markup Language (HTML) syntax used to support user interface.

Project: Structure a user interface with HTML

Drivers: To learn and use HTML to create and visually represent a webpage.

Technology:  HyperText Markup Language, Sublime Text Editor, Terminal, Unix Command Line, Web browsers (FireFox, Chrome, Safari, IE.9), Git, GitHub  

Resources: Mozilla Developer Network (MDN), W3C HTML Validation Service, Learning Web App Development text, Lorem Ipsum

The typical workflow will be to open the file in Sublime text editor, make minor changes and reload the web browswer to see changes.  hello.html will be the primary file used throughout this project.  All changes in sequence can be viewed in commits.

Notes:

Document Object Model (DOM) and Trees: 

HTML tags define a hierarchical structure called the DOM
DOM represents objects defined via HTML and then later interacted with via a scripting language, like JavaScript.

Tags define DOM elements
